# Bound Sensor Project
I started this project because I couldn't find any easy way to find out once an element size inside of DOM changes. This doesn't exist until this day that I write this package by native browser except `onresize` for window.  
I wrote this lightweight library to receive an event once an element's boundary changes.

## Bound Sensor
This is the base library that is written for JavaScript project, you can find [the code here](https://github.com/aminpaks/bound-sensor/tree/master/modules/bound-sensor) and a working [example here](https://github.com/aminpaks/bound-sensor/tree/master/examples/bound-sensor-demo).

## Angular Bound Sensor
This is a very small `@Directive` based on `bound-sensor` that does the job for you in Angular world. You can find [the code here](https://github.com/aminpaks/bound-sensor/tree/master/modules/angular-bound-sensor) and also an [example here](https://github.com/aminpaks/bound-sensor/tree/master/examples/angular-bound-sensor-demo).
